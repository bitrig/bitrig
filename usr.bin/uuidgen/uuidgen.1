.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uuidgen
.Nd generate universally unique identifiers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 1s
.Op Fl n Ar count
.Op Fl o Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility uses the
.Xr uuidgen 2
system call to generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).
By default,
.Nm
generates a single UUID and outputs it in the standard string representation
to
.Em stdout .
The following options can be used to change the behavior of
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width XoXfilenameXX
.It Fl 1
This option only has effect if multiple identifiers are to be generated and
instructs
.Nm
not to generate them in batch, but one at a time.
.It Fl n Ar count
This option controls the number of identifiers generated.
By default, multiple identifiers are generated in batch.
.It Fl o Ar filename
Redirect output to
.Ar filename
instead of
.Em stdout .
.It Fl s
Output UUIDs as initialized C structures, rather than in the standard
string format.
.El
.Pp
Batched generation yields a set of numerically consecutive identifiers.
.Pp
Generating UUIDs one at a time might yield identifiers that are
numerically close, but not necessarily consecutive.
