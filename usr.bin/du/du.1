.Sh NAME
.Nm du
.Nd display disk usage statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm du
.Op Fl d Ar depth
.Op Fl achkrsx
.Op Fl H | L | P
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays the file system block usage for each
.Ar file
argument
and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directory
argument.
Note that the system block usage is usually greater than
the actual size of the file.
If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy rooted in
the current directory is displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display entries for files in addition to entries for directories.
.It Fl c
Display the grand total after all the arguments have been processed.
.It Fl d Ar depth
Do not display entries for files and directories more than
.Ar depth
levels deep;
.Fl d Cm 0
has the same effect as
.Fl s .
Overrides earlier
.Fl d
and
.Fl s
options.
.It Fl H
Symbolic links on the command line are followed.
Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.
.It Fl h
"Human-readable" output.
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, Exabyte in order to reduce the number of
digits to four or less.
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl L
All symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
No symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl r
Generate messages about directories that cannot be read, files
that cannot be opened, and so on.
This is the default.
.It Fl s
Display only the total for each of the specified files and directories.
Overrides earlier
.Fl d
options.
.It Fl x
File system mount points are not traversed.
.El
.Pp
It is not an error to specify more than one of
the mutually exclusive options
.Fl h
and
.Fl k .
Where more than one of these options is specified,
the last option given overrides the others.
.Pp
.Nm
counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the files they
reference unless the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
option is specified.
If either the
.Fl H
or
.Fl L
options are specified, storage used by any symbolic links which are
followed is not counted or displayed.
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L ,
and
.Fl P
options override each other and the command's actions are determined
by the last one specified.
.Pp
Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
time per
.Nm
execution.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
Block counts will be displayed in units of this size block, unless the
.Fl k
or
.Fl h
option is specified.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std du
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl cdhP ,
as well as the
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
environment variable,
are extensions to that specification.
.Pp
The flag
.Op Fl r
is accepted but ignored, for compatibility with systems implementing
the obsolete
.St -xcu5
standard.
.Sh HISTORY

.Nm
utility and its
.Fl a
and
.Fl s
options first appeared in
.At v1 .

.Fl r
option first appeared in

.Fl k
and
.Fl x
options first appeared in

options first appeared in the GNU fileutils;
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
are available since
.Bx 4.4 Lite1 ,
.Fl c
since
.Ox 2.1 .
