 * ffs - find first set bit, this algorithm isolates the first set
 * bit, then multiplies the number by 0x0450fbaf which leaves the top
 * 6 bits as an index into the table.  This algorithm should be a win
 * over the checking each bit in turn as per the C compiled version.
 *
 * under ARMv5 there's an instruction called CLZ (count leading Zero's) that
 * could be used
 *
 * This is the ffs algorithm devised by d.seal and posted to comp.sys.arm on
 * 16 Feb 1994.
