This directory contains examples of my enhancements to MM.

APP		The appendix macro.
B1B2		Box macro with text.
COVER		My general cover macro, this example is using
		ms.cov.
IND		A general indexing method, see manual for INITI.
LT		The letter macro.
LT.se		A Swedish example with the extra
		Swedish macros for getting a letter conforming
		to Swedish standard letter, both left and right adjusted.
ML		Marked list, an extended list type.
MOVE		The MOVE macro, how to begin to print on an exact position.
MUL		Enhanced multicolumn mode.
NCOL		Start on next column. (Not for MUL*)
ND		New date, with ISO date example.
References	How to use references.
SETR		General reference system, see manual for INITR.


Examples that I should have:

PIC		How to include postscript pictures, see manual for PIC.
VERBON		Begin verbatim output.


And remember, check the manual for all string and number registers,
I've made sure that mgm is useful in several languages;
all English output can be redefined.

For Swedish localization, check the manual for groff_mse and the
macro files `mse.tmac' and `sv.tmac'.
