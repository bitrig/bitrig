        * release of groffer 1.0.0

	Changements of the shell version since 0.9.31

	* shell/groffer.sh: Use version.sh in the upper directory.

2006-10-02  Bernd Warken

	The groffer versions 1.* have two kinds of program, a shell
	version and a Perl version.

	The shell version is kept from the old shell only versions of
	groffer 0.*.  Most of the former files in the main groffer
	directory are now moved to the subdirectoy shell/.

	The Perl version of groffer is a complete rewrite; most of its
	files are found in the subdirectory perl/.

	The Makefile.sub decides whether the shell or Perl version of
	groffer is installed.  This is done by the program perl_test.pl.

	In the following, all files in the groffer directory tree are
	mentioned.

	* ChangeLog: This file.  It contains information for `groffer'
	versions >= 1.0.0 with shell and Perl kinds.  For older `groffer'
	versions, see `shell/ChangeLog.0' which contains information for the
	shell only versions of groffer 0.*.

	* Makefile.sub: The old `Makefile.sub' was extended to support the
	shell and the Perl version of `groffer' at the same time.  If the
	test of `perl_test.pl' succeeds the `groffer' Perl version will be
	installed, otherwise the shell version is used.

	* perl_test.pl: This is used by `Makefile.sub' and installed with
	the Perl version of `groffer'.  It is a test of the installed perl
	version.  The installed Perl version should be greater or equal
	than the version that is required by this file.

	* version.sh: This is the old file kept from the shell version of
	`groffer'.  It stores the `groffer' version, the date of the last
	update, and the `groff' version.  It is used and installed for the
	shell and Perl version of `groffer'.

	* README: This is the old `README' file extended by information on
	the shell and Perl kinds of `groffer'.

	* perl/: Subdirectory for the Perl version of `groffer'.

	* perl/groffer.pl: This is the `groffer' script of the Perl
	version, a Perl source file that handles the complete groffer
	functionality.

	* perl/man.pl: This is the collection of functions that are
	related to man pages, `apropos', and `whatis'.  It is loaded by
	`perl/groffer.pl'.

	* perl/func.pl: This is the collection of miscellaneous functions.
	It is loaded by `perl/groffer.pl'.

	* perl/split_env.sh: A shell script that is used by
	`perl/groffer.pl' to split a large shell environment variable to a
	Perl array.

	* perl/groffer.man: This is the man page of the Perl version of
	`groffer'.  It is derived from `groffer.man' of the shell version.
	It will only be installed when the `Makefile.sub' chooses to
	install the Perl version of 'groffer' instead of the shell
	version.

	* perl/README_PERL: This file contains information of the Perl
	compatibility and details that are special to the Perl version.

	* shell/: Subdirectory for the shell version of `groffer'.

	* shell/ChangeLog.0: The former `ChangeLog' file of the groffer
	versions 0.* was moved to this file.  It contains information of
	the shell only version of groffer 0.*.

	* shell/groffer.sh: This is the old `groffer.sh' file of the shell
	version.

	* shell/groffer2.sh: This is the old `groffer2.sh' file of the
	shell version.

	* shell/groffer.man: This is the old man page groffer.man of the
	shell version.  The shell version keeps its own man page.  It will
	only be installed when the `Makefile.sub' chooses to install the
	shell version instead of the Perl version.

	* shell/README_SH: This is the old `README_SH' file of the shell
	version containing information of the shell compatibility.

	The former part of the ChangeLog file is in `shell/ChangeLog.0'.
