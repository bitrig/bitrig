first line of the reference is indented more than the second.
---Fixed---

Version 1.5
===========
DROPCAP not printing the dropcap letter at all in PRINTSTYLE
TYPEWRITE, nor when DROPCAP is used (accidentally?) after a valid
"first" paragraph.
---FIXED---

DROPCAP going into an infinite loop when groff called with the
-Tascii switch.
---FIXED---

SHIFT_LIST, when used anywhere but with a top-level list, is killing

---Fixed---

CAPS OFF, called inline with \*[CAPS OFF] not working.
(Added two new inlines, \*[UC] and \*[LC], to do the job.)
---Fixed---

When type is set after START but no docelement tag given, the
expected family ($DOC_FAMILY) and font (R) are not in effect.
---Fixed---

When DOCTYPE is CHAPTER and .TITLE is omitted after .COLLATE, the
title vanishes from page headers/footers.
---Fixed---

Version 1.4-a

---Fixed---

Version 1.3-e_3
===============
ENDNOTES is not, by default, printing headers on endnotes pages.
---Fixed---

Processing of the "Endnotes" title for the TOC is putting the
page number 1 line too high and not inserting leader.
---Fixed---

Collated docs not respecting $PP_FT (it's picking up the font from
the pagenumber font)
---Fixed---

Docheader spacing sometimes depositing too much space between
various docheader elements in TYPEWRITE when DOCTYPE is DEFAULT or
NAMED.
---Fixed---

When COLUMNS are on, subheads that are deferred to the next
column/page because there isn't enough room for the s/h and one
line of text are causing columns to overprint.
---Fixed---

HDRFTR_LEFT printing one line too high when .HEADER_COLOR is used.
---Fixed---

DOCTITLE link broken in the docs.
---Fixed---

Version 1.3-e_2
===============
TOC formatting incorrect when the pound/number sign (#) is used in
head elements.
---Fixed---

[Documentation]: The docs erroneously state that TOC control macros
can be entered anywhere in a file prior to invoking TOC (they should
be entered before START).
---Fixed---

Page numbers in the bottom margin being printed too low on output
pages preceding an invocation of COLLATE or macros that call it.
---Fixed---

A superfluous blank, numbered page is being generated by COLLATE
(and macros that call it, namely TOC and ENDNOTES) when the last
line of output text before it falls on the last valid baseline of
an output page.  Same thing happening occasionally with normal
document termination.
---Fixed---

SHIFT_LIST not being observed when moving *back* to a shifted list;
the list is reverting to the left margin.
---Fixed---

NUMBER_SUBHEADS not working with TYPESET when PARA_SPACE is on.
---Fixed---

Version 1.3-e_1
===============
Missing #COLLATE register (accidentally wiped out) creating various

examples/typesetting.mom
---Fixed---

PAD_LIST_DIGITS/SHIFT_LIST broken when the enumerator type is
roman or ROMAN.
---Fixed---

---Fixed---

DOC_LEAD_ADJUST OFF not being observed when COLLATE is invoked.
---Fixed---

DROPCAP setting the dropcap too high in initial paragraph after a
COLLATE.
---Fixed---

Version 1.3-c
=============
Owing to a superfluous "if" in the FONT macro, the "missing font"
routine is being silently ignored.
---Fixed---

FOOTNOTE, used in nofill mode, adds a linebreak between the
marker and the text of the footnote.
---Fixed---

Version 1.3-b
=============

---Fixed---

Underlining of italic passages in PRINTSTYLE TYEPWRITE not spanning
pages.
---Fixed---

PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE depositing extra space on new pages above quotes
that span pages.
---Fixed---

MN doesn't accept OFF, QUIT, END, X, etc.
---Fixed---

Margin notes that begin flush with the last line of text on a page
are running down the same page, instead of the remainder being
collected and output on the next.
---Fixed---

MN sometimes erroneously dropping margin notes near the bottom of
a page, even when they'd fit.  (MN-shifted not being removed by
MN-top.)
---Fixed---

MN_INIT not accepting "" args for default values.
---Fixed---

Documentation for margin notes erroneously states that the first
(optional) argument can be either "ragged" or "symmetric".  S/b
"RAGGED" or "SYMMETRIC".
---Fixed---

Use of "" to tell MN_INIT to use the default for any specific
argument in the arg list broken.
---Fixed---

preceding paragraph has no corresponding close quote (i.e. dialogue
passages containing multiple paragraphs) are starting off with a
close quote.
---Fixed---

Version 1.3-a
=============

First baseline of type isn't going where it's supposed to when the
docheader is turned off.
---Fixed---

Version 1.3
===========

Persistent error in html coding of docs (<nobr> tag).
---Fixed---

Version 1.2-f
============

Multiple line subheads near page bottom sometimes printing one line
of subhead at page bottom, and subsequent lines on next page.
---Fixed---

---Fixed--- (for good would be nice)

RULE not always resetting quad and quad value.
---Fixed---

Version 1.2-e

followed by a subhead.
---Fixed---

When LS is invoked after a single text line at the top of a page
containing a T_MARGIN (set with T_MARGIN or PAGE), mom is performing
spacing adjustments as if the first line doesn't exist.
---Fixed---

Changes made to ALD and LS in version 1.2-c should not apply when
the document processing macros are used.  There is a significant
conflict with the internal use of ALD when the docheader is only
one line long (as, for example, when DOCTYPE is CHAPTER).
---Fixed, pending discovery of further conflicts---

Version 1.2-c
=============

Deferred footnotes not always being output, and groff complains
"ending diversion FN_OVERFLOW on exit."
---Fixed---

First .LS call after a top margin has been set (with .T_MARGIN
or .PAGE) causing mom to move off the top margin baseline.  Also,

COND or EXT are given as arguments to DROPCAP.

are output, or after PROCESS_FN_LEFTOVER/PROCESS_FN_IN_DIVER.
---Fixed---

COL_NEXT and COL_BREAK, when invoked during the last column on a
page, are overprinting the last column instead of breaking to a new
page when there are footnotes in the column.
---Fixed---

BR_AT_LINE_KERN not "break-and-spreading" text when used in
justified copy.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.8
=============

#FN_COUNT_FOR_COLS for all footnote markers and handling.

documents not printing.
---Fixed---

not vertically centered.

DOC_QUAD not automatically set immediately after START
---Fixed--

Tabs behaving erratically during document processing.
---Fixed---

=============

When DOCHEADER OFF <distance> is given, if <distance> falls short
of the top margin of running text, <distance> is not respected and
bottom margin falls low.
---Fixed---


Version 1.1.6-e
===============

The " mark (doublequote), when entered while not in document
processing mode (i.e. just straightforward typesetting), outputs
nothing unless SMARQUOTES is invoked explicitly.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-c
===============

In document processing mode, docs that use *none* of the
docprocessing tags being ignored.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-b
===============

String tabs not picking up #L_MARGIN when #L_MARGIN not explicitly
set with L_MARGIN, PAPER or PAGE.
---Fixed---

Infinite loop when B_MARGIN is set lower than FOOTER_MARGIN during
doc processing.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-a
===============

Mom partially broken when run with groff 1.19.1.  Don't know yet
what this is, whether bad coding in mom, or a problem with 1.19.1.
Only solution for now: run mom 1.1.6 with groff 1.18.
----Fixed---

Top margin of endnotes pages after the first endnotes page when
PRINTSTYLE is TYPEWRITE and endnotes single-spacing is turned on
falling one line too high.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6
=============

---Fixed---

.WS and .SS not cooperating.
---Fixed---

.RW and .EW not working.
---Fixed---

========================================================================

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

The indent macros from the typesetting macro set may not always
perform well in conjunction with the document processing macros,
especially when documents are set in columns.  Mostly, this is the
result of inadequate testing.  There are only so many "who'd want to
do this anyway?" scenarios I can think of on my own.

Epigraphs at the bottoms of page may sometimes run exactly one line
deeper than they should.  The alternative (from my point of view) is
to have them run 1 line shorter than they should.  The problem stems
from the fact the epigraphs are leaded differently than all other text,
and there's only so much adjusting that can be done with the whitespace
surrounding them to get them to bottom align.  Since stylistically,
epigraphs should never appear at the bottom of a page/column without at
least some running text beneath them in order to make sense of the role
they play in page layout, this not likely to be fixed for some time.
